<h2>Price prediction project</h2>

In this project I've done a model to predict possible price of the real estate in Tokyo city.

1. Data
<ul>
  <li>For the base I used this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nishiodens/japan-real-estate-transaction-prices</li>
  <li>Then I trimmed it and did all the preparations. Processed dataset can be seen in repo. It's zipped</li>
</ul>

2. Models
<ul>
  <li>at first I did regression with numpy and bare python</li>
  <li>then I used sklearn to unleash regressions of various kinds: from Ridge() to RandomForestRegressor</li>
</ul>
